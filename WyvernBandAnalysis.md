# Wyvern Satellite 23-Band Spectral Analysis

This document provides a visual and analytical overview of the 23-band multispectral data captured by the Wyvern satellite. The analysis covers the distribution of wavelengths across bands, the spectral region classification, and the corresponding visual color associations.

## Wavelength Distribution by Band

The bar chart below illustrates the relationship between band numbers and their corresponding wavelengths in nanometers (nm). The color of each bar represents its approximate position in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) electromagnetic spectrum.

## Electromagnetic Spectrum Classification

The scatter plot below shows how each band fits into the electromagnetic spectrum. Each dot represents a band and is color-coded according to its spectral region (e.g., green, red, NIR).

## Band-Spectrum Mapping Summary

The table below provides a summary of the band-to-wavelength mapping, including the associated spectral region and visual color name. This mapping is helpful for interpreting and visualizing multispectral imagery for remote sensing applications.

## Use Case Summary

- **Vegetation Monitoring**: Bands transitioning from red to NIR (e.g., B13–B23) are critical for indices like NDVI.
- **Crop Classification**: High spectral resolution supports distinguishing crop types by reflectance.
- **Land Cover Analysis**: Broad coverage from 503–799 nm enables robust environmental and land use monitoring.
